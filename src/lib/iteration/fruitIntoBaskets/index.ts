/**
 * @module fruitIntoBaskets
 * @description
 * The Fruit into Baskets problem is a classic sliding window problem.
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
 * The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
 * You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
 * @example
 * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
 *
 * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
 * Output: 5
 *
 * Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
 * This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
 *
 * @param {string[]} fruits - array of fruits
 * @returns {number} - maximum number of fruits in both the baskets
